<h2>This is perhaps the most authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe you will find!</h2>

<p>Authentic Neapolitan pizza originates from the birthplace of pizza, Naples. 
    It involves simple ingredients and traditional methods that have been largely forgotten for quite a while.
    Luckily it is bouncing back, with many people finding this beautiful style of pizza for the first time.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ball Best Homemade Pizza Dough</li> 
    <li>⅓ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
    <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about ¾ cup shredded mozzarella)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 basil leaves</li>
    <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the dough using the Best Pizza Dough recipe. Follow the preparation instructions in the dough recipe if prepared in advance.</li>
    <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven.</li>
    <li>Make the Homemade Pizza Sauce.</li>
    <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
    <li>When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top. Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese.  Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.</li>
    <li>If you’re baking in a pizza oven, add the basil leaves. For baking in a standard oven, add the basil leaves after you bake (the leaves turn black in a standard oven).</li>
    <li>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
