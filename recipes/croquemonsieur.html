<h2>Croque Monsieur is a delicious French ham and cheese sandwich made with gruyere, parmesan, ham and a simple béchamel sauce, toasted in the oven.</h2>

<p>This Croque Monsieur recipe is inspired by the two trips to France I’ve taken over the years. You can find a Croque Monsieur or Croque Madame sandwich on almost every restaurant menu in Paris.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>8 thin slices white sandwich breads</li>
    <li>5 ounces good quality ham about 8 slices</li>
    <li>6 ounces Gruyere cheese ,or Emmental cheese, grated (about 2½ cups)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Add ham and cheese. Add one layer of ham and a sprinkle of cheese to half of the bread slices.</li>
    <li>Top with bread.  Top the ham and cheese with another slice of bread, making sure to leave the béchamel facing up.</li>
