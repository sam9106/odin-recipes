<h2>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd. </h2>

<p>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the patty’s juiciness. </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ground Beef – We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).</li>
    <li>Sauce – A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</li>
    <li>Cheese – we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.</li>
    <li>Buns – brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work </li>
    <li>Lettuce – thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger</li>
    <li>Pickles – sliced dill pickle chips are the best </li>
    <li>Tomatoes – Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings</li>
    <li>Red onion – thinly sliced into rings</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare Patties – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
    <li>Make Sauce – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prep Toppings – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
    <li>Toast buns – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
    <li>Cook patties – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
    <li>Add cheese – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
